# SVG Fractals

Final project for the discipline of _Introduction to Computer Graphics_ at the undergraduate course of _Applied Mathematics_ at EMAp FGV. Implementation of simulation of different fractals that can be visualized while being generated. A fractal can be described as a structure that repeats itself infinitely. It uses SVG to represent the shapes on the screen and contains different interactivity options. It is available at the [link](https://giovanivaldrighi.github.io/SVG_Fractals).

# Files organization

The files of the project are separated in the following folders:

- `/docs`: constains HTML files of the web page, and the Javascript code for the simulation of the fractals.

# Requirements and How to run

All the implementations were made with Javascript with the intent to be used by any user that has not contact with programming, so to run you just need to access the web page.
